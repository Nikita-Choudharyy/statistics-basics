# Basic Probability

Probability measures the **likelihood of an event occurring**.
Its value always lies between **0 and 1**.

## What is Probability?

Probability of an event is defined as:

Probability = (Number of favourable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

---

## Key Terms

### Experiment
An action that produces outcomes.  
Example: Tossing a coin.

### Outcome
A possible result of an experiment.  
Example: Head or Tail.

### Sample Space (S)
The set of all possible outcomes.  
Example:  
For a coin toss, S = {H, T}

### Event
A subset of the sample space.  
Example: Getting Head.

## Types of Events

### 1. Certain Event
An event that will always occur.  
Probability = 1

### 2. Impossible Event
An event that cannot occur.  
Probability = 0

### 3. Random Event
An event that may or may not occur.  
0 < Probability < 1

## Probability Rules

- 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1  
- P(S) = 1  
- P(Not A) = 1 − P(A)

---

## Example

### Tossing a Coin
Sample space: {H, T}

- P(H) = 1 / 2  
- P(T) = 1 / 2  

---

### Rolling a Die
Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

- Probability of getting an even number = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2  
- Probability of getting number 5 = 1 / 6

## Practice Questions with Answers

### 1. What is the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed?

**Answer:**  
1 / 2

---

### 2. What is the probability of getting a number greater than 4 when a die is rolled?

Favourable outcomes = {5, 6}  
Total outcomes = 6  

**Answer:**  
2 / 6 = 1 / 3

---

### 3. If the probability of an event A is 0.35, what is the probability of not A?

**Answer:**  
1 − 0.35 = 0.65
