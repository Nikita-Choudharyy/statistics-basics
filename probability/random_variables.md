# Random Variables

A random variable is a **numerical value assigned to the outcome of a random experiment**.
It converts outcomes into numbers so that mathematical analysis becomes possible.

## What is a Random Variable?

A random variable represents possible outcomes of a random experiment in numerical form.

Example:
- Tossing a coin  
  - Head → 1  
  - Tail → 0  

Here, the numerical value is the random variable.

## Types of Random Variables

There are two main types of random variables:

---

## 1. Discrete Random Variable

A discrete random variable takes **countable values**.

### Examples
- Number of heads in 3 coin tosses  
- Number of students present in a class  
- Rolling a die (values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

---

### Example
Let X = number of heads when a coin is tossed twice.

Possible values of X:
- 0 (TT)
- 1 (HT, TH)
- 2 (HH)

X = {0, 1, 2}

## 2. Continuous Random Variable

A continuous random variable takes **uncountable values** within a range.

### Examples
- Height of students  
- Time taken to complete a task  
- Temperature of a city  

These values can take **any real number** within an interval.

## Difference Between Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

|    Feature     |     Discrete     |     Continuous      |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Values         | Countable        | Uncountable         |
| Examples       | Dice outcome     | Height, weight      |
| Representation | Probability mass | Probability density |

## Why Random Variables are Important?

- They form the base for **probability distributions**
- Used in expectation, variance, and standard deviation
- Essential in statistics, data science, and machine learning
