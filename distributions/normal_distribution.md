# Normal Distribution

The **Normal Distribution** (also called Gaussian Distribution) is the most important probability distribution in statistics.

It is a **continuous**, **bell-shaped**, and **symmetric** distribution.

## Key Properties of Normal Distribution

- Bell-shaped curve  
- Mean = Median = Mode  
- Symmetric around the mean  
- Total area under the curve = 1  
- Data near the mean is most frequent  
- Defined by two parameters:
  - Mean (μ)
  - Standard Deviation (σ)

## Probability Density Function (PDF)

For a normal distribution:

f(x) = (1 / (σ√2π)) * e^(-(x - μ)² / (2σ²))

You don't have to memorize it — this is used internally in probability calculations.

## Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

In a normal distribution:

- **68%** of data lies within **1σ** of mean  
- **95%** lies within **2σ**  
- **99.7%** lies within **3σ**  

This helps understand the spread of data.

## Example

A class average height is normally distributed with:

μ = 160 cm  
σ = 10 cm  

### Interpretation:
- 68% students have height between **150 and 170 cm**
- 95% students have height between **140 and 180 cm**

## Z-Score

A Z-score tells **how many standard deviations** a value is from the mean:

z = (x - μ) / σ

---

### Example:
A student scored 85 in a test with:

μ = 70  
σ = 10  

z = (85 - 70) / 10 = **1.5**

➡ Means the score is **1.5 standard deviations above the mean**

## Applications of Normal Distribution

- Quality control  
- Height, weight analysis  
- Machine learning algorithms  
- Finance, risk modeling  
- Statistical inference
