## Descriptive Statistics

### 1. What is the difference between mean and median?

**Answer:**  
Mean is the average of all values.  
Median is the middle value when data is arranged in order.  
Median is less affected by extreme values.

### 2. When is mode useful?

**Answer:**  
Mode is useful for categorical data and when identifying the most frequent value.

---

## Probability

### 3. What is conditional probability?

**Answer:**  
It is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.

---

### 4. What does Bayes' Theorem help determine?

**Answer:**  
It helps update probabilities based on new evidence.

---

## Distributions

### 5. When should we use a binomial distribution?

**Answer:**  
When there are fixed trials, two outcomes, constant probability, and independent events.

---

### 6. What is the key difference between binomial and Poisson distribution?

**Answer:**  
Binomial has fixed number of trials.  
Poisson models number of occurrences in a fixed interval.

---

## Inferential Statistics

### 7. What is the purpose of hypothesis testing?

**Answer:**  
To determine whether sample data provides enough evidence to reject a population claim.

---

### 8. When should we use a t-test instead of a Z-test?

**Answer:**  
When sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown.

---

### 9. What does ANOVA test?

**Answer:**  
It tests whether means of three or more groups are equal.

---

### 10. What does a p-value represent?

**Answer:**  
The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results,
assuming the null hypothesis is true.
