# Z-Test

The **Z-test** is a hypothesis test used to determine whether a sample mean
is significantly different from a population mean **when the population standard deviation is known**.

---

## When to Use Z-Test?

Use a Z-test when:
1. Sample size is large (n ≥ 30)
2. Population standard deviation (σ) is known
3. Data is approximately normally distributed

---

## Z-Test Formula

Z = (x̄ − μ) / (σ / √n)

Where:
- x̄ = sample mean  
- μ = population mean  
- σ = population standard deviation  
- n = sample size  

---

## Steps in Z-Test

1. State null and alternative hypothesis  
2. Choose significance level (α)  
3. Calculate Z value  
4. Find critical value or p-value  
5. Make decision  

---

## Types of Z-Test

- Left-tailed test  
- Right-tailed test  
- Two-tailed test

## Example (Step-by-Step)

A company claims that the average battery life is **50 hours**.

Given:
- μ = 50  
- x̄ = 52  
- σ = 5  
- n = 100  
- α = 0.05  

### Step 1: Hypotheses
H₀: μ = 50  
H₁: μ ≠ 50  

---

### Step 2: Calculate Z value

Z = (52 − 50) / (5 / √100)  
Z = 2 / 0.5  
Z = **4**

---

### Step 3: Decision

Critical Z value at α = 0.05 (two-tailed) = ±1.96  

Since |Z| > 1.96 → **Reject H₀**

---

## Conclusion

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the average battery life
is different from 50 hours.

## Practice Questions with Answers

### 1. When should a Z-test be used?

**Answer:**  
When population standard deviation is known and sample size is large.

---

### 2. If Z = 1.2 and critical Z = 1.96, what is the decision?

**Answer:**  
Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

---

### 3. What happens if |Z| > critical value?

**Answer:**  
Reject the null hypothesis.
