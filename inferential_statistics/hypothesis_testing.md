# Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to **make decisions about a population**
based on sample data.

It helps determine whether an assumption about the population is **supported by evidence**.

## What is a Hypothesis?

A hypothesis is a **statement about a population parameter**.

There are two types of hypotheses:

### 1. Null Hypothesis (H₀)
- Assumes no effect or no difference
- Default assumption

### 2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
- Represents the effect or difference we want to test

---

## Example

H₀: The average height of students is 160 cm  
H₁: The average height of students is not 160 cm  

---

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. State the null and alternative hypothesis  
2. Choose the significance level (α)  
3. Select the appropriate test  
4. Calculate test statistic  
5. Make a decision (reject or fail to reject H₀)

---

## Significance Level (α)

- Common values: 0.05, 0.01
- It represents the **probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis**

---

## Decision Rule

- If **p-value ≤ α** → Reject H₀  
- If **p-value > α** → Fail to reject H₀  

---

## Types of Hypothesis Tests

- Z-test  
- t-test  
- Chi-square test  
- F-test  
- ANOVA  

(Each test is used in different situations)

## One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Test

|  Test Type |        Description      |
|------------|-------------------------|
| One-tailed | Test in one direction   |
| Two-tailed | Test in both directions |

---

## Simple Example

A company claims that the average weight of a packet is 500 g.

H₀: μ = 500  
H₁: μ ≠ 500  

Based on sample data, hypothesis testing is used to verify the claim.

## Practice Questions with Answers

### 1. What is the null hypothesis?

**Answer:**  
The default assumption stating no effect or no difference.

---

### 2. What does significance level represent?

**Answer:**  
The probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis.

---

### 3. If p-value = 0.03 and α = 0.05, what is the decision?

**Answer:**  
Reject the null hypothesis.
