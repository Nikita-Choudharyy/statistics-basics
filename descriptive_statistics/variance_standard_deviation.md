# Variance and Standard Deviation

Variance and Standard Deviation are measures of **dispersion**.  
They describe how much the data values **spread around the mean**.

---

## Variance

Variance measures the **average squared deviation** from the mean.

### Formula
For population:
Variance (σ²) = Σ(x − μ)² / N  

For sample:
Variance (s²) = Σ(x − x̄)² / (n − 1)

---

### Example
Data: 2, 4, 6, 8  

Mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / 4 = 5  

Deviations from mean:  
(2 − 5)² = 9  
(4 − 5)² = 1  
(6 − 5)² = 1  
(8 − 5)² = 9  

Sum of squared deviations = 20  

Variance = 20 / 4 = **5**

---

## Standard Deviation

Standard Deviation is the **square root of variance**.  
It is expressed in the **same unit as the data**.

### Formula
Standard Deviation = √Variance

### Example
Variance = 5  

Standard Deviation = √5 ≈ **2.24**

---

## Why Variance Uses Squared Values?

- To avoid negative deviations canceling each other  
- To give more weight to values far from the mean

## Comparison

|      Measure       |     Unit       |   Interpretation  |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Variance           | Squared units  | Spread of data    |
| Standard Deviation | Original units | Typical deviation |

## When to Use

- **Variance** → theoretical analysis  
- **Standard Deviation** → practical interpretation of spread

## Practice Questions with Answers

### 1. Find the variance of the data: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Mean = (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9) / 5 = 5  

Squared deviations:  
(1 − 5)² = 16  
(3 − 5)² = 4  
(5 − 5)² = 0  
(7 − 5)² = 4  
(9 − 5)² = 16  

Sum = 40  

Variance = 40 / 5 = **8**

---

### 2. If variance is 16, find standard deviation.

Standard Deviation = √16 = **4**

---

### 3. Which measure is easier to interpret: variance or standard deviation?

**Answer:**  
Standard deviation, because it is expressed in the same unit as the data.
