# Mean, Median and Mode

Mean, Median and Mode are measures of **central tendency**.  
They are used to represent a dataset with a single central value.

## Mean (Arithmetic Mean)

Mean is the average of all observations.

### Formula
Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

### Example
Data: 2, 4, 6, 8  

Mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / 4 = 5

---

## Median

Median is the **middle value** of an ordered dataset.

### Steps
1. Arrange the data in ascending order  
2. If the number of observations is:
   - **Odd** → middle value  
   - **Even** → average of two middle values  

### Example (Odd count)
Data: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11  
Median = 7

### Example (Even count)
Data: 2, 4, 6, 8  
Median = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5

---

## Mode

Mode is the value that occurs **most frequently** in the dataset.

### Example
Data: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4  
Mode = 2

> A dataset can have:
- One mode  
- More than one mode  
- No mode

## Comparison

| Measure |   Based on   | Affected by Outliers |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Mean    | All values   | Yes                  |
| Median  | Middle value | No                   |
| Mode    |  Frequency   | No                   |

## When to Use What?

- **Mean** → when data has no extreme values  
- **Median** → when data contains outliers  
- **Mode** → for categorical or frequency-based data

## Practice Questions with Answers

### 1. Find mean, median, and mode of:  
**5, 10, 15, 20, 25**

**Solution:**  
- Mean = (5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25) / 5 = 75 / 5 = **15**  
- Median = middle value = **15**  
- Mode = all values occur once → **No mode**

---

### 2. Which measure of central tendency is most suitable when data contains extreme values?

**Answer:**  
**Median**

**Reason:**  
Median is not affected by very large or very small values, whereas mean is affected by outliers.

---

### 3. Can a dataset have more than one mode? Explain with an example.

**Answer:**  
Yes, a dataset can have more than one mode.

**Example:**  
Data: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5  

Here, 3 and 4 both occur twice.  
So, the dataset is **bimodal** with modes **3 and 4**.
