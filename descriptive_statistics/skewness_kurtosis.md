# Skewness and Kurtosis

Skewness and Kurtosis describe the **shape of a data distribution**.
They help us understand how data is **distributed around the mean**.

---

## Skewness

Skewness measures the **asymmetry** of a distribution.

### Types of Skewness

#### 1. Positive Skewness (Right Skewed)
- Tail is longer on the right side
- Mean > Median > Mode

**Example:** Income distribution

---

#### 2. Negative Skewness (Left Skewed)
- Tail is longer on the left side
- Mean < Median < Mode

**Example:** Age at retirement in a company

---

#### 3. Zero Skewness
- Distribution is symmetric
- Mean = Median = Mode

**Example:** Normal distribution

---

## Kurtosis

Kurtosis measures the **peakedness or flatness** of a distribution.

### Types of Kurtosis

#### 1. Leptokurtic
- Sharp peak
- Heavy tails
- More outliers

---

#### 2. Mesokurtic
- Moderate peak
- Normal distribution

---

#### 3. Platykurtic
- Flat peak
- Light tails
- Fewer outliers

## Comparison

| Measure  |  Describes |      Focus        |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Skewness | Asymmetry  | Direction of tail |
| Kurtosis | Peakedness | Outliers & tails  |

## Why Skewness and Kurtosis Matter

- Help understand data distribution shape
- Useful before applying statistical models
- Important in data analysis and ML preprocessing
